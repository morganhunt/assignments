        <h1>A Trip Down Under</h1>
        
        <p> While Australia would be nice, New Zealand would be my ideal destination.</p>

        <p>I would see scenes like they film in movies, plenty of rich forests and images worthy of being painted--if I could paint, anyway. I'll settle for photos. </p>

        <p>I would love to see a kiwi, a bird that can't fly and has a ridiculously long beak to match its legs, but unfortunately this website doesn't have any pictures of them. I would definitely enjoy seeing a komodo dragon, though, even though I'm not sure they have any in New Zealand.</p>

        <p>While I'm not sure what kind of food New Zealand is famous for, I'm certain an island would have wonderful seafood to try.</p>
